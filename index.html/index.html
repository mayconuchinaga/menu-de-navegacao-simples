<h1>Hey billie, you there?</h1>
<p>
    Uh,uh
    <br>
    You wanna guess the color of my underwear
    <br>
    You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
    <br>
    Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
    <br>
    Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?]
    <br>
    You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
    <br>
    You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
    <br>
    Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
    <br><br>
    You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about (yeah)
    <br>
    Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
    <br>
    Pull it to the side and get all up in it
    <br>
    Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
    <br>
    Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
    <br>
    Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
    <br>
    Pull it to the side and get all up in it
    <br>
    Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
    <br>
    Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
    <br>
    (Work it out)
    <br><br>
    Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
    <br>
    Already know what you've got goin' on down there
    <br>
    It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
    <br>
    The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
    <br>
    I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
    <br>
    I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about
    <br><br>
    I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
    <br>
    Pull it to the side and get all up in it
    <br>
    Kiss it, bite it, can I fit it?
    <br>
    Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it
    <br>
    (Knows I'd hit it)
    <br>
    Charli, call me if you're with it
    <br><br>
    Yeah, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
    <br>
    Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
    <br>
    Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
    <br>
    Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
    <br><br>
    You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin' about? (You've been disrespectful)
    <br>
    Still tryin' to guess the password to my Google Drive (are you obsessed with me?)
    <br>
    You wanna guess the address of the party we're at (you really are not invited)
    <br>
    You wanna guess if we're serious about this song</p>
